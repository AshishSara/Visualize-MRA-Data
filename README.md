# Visualize-MRI-Data

This project uses Python specifically Jupyter Notebook to visualize 3D MRI data via 2D images. Some of the libraries used are specific Jupyter Notebook usage so be sure to download the software to run the program as intended by myself. 

The imaging data was obtained from the following website (https://decathlon-10.grand-challenge.org/), specifically the "Task01_BrainTumour.tar" file and is credited to the following academic paper: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-30695-9. 

I only included 2 of the files in each "Images" and "Label" folder because of the large size of each folder in its originality. 

Thank you!
